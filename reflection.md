- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Kiara Sunil Singh - My initial impression of inheritance is that it can be very useful and can make the coding process more efficient because it eliminates the need to rewrite existing code. I found that it can also help with maintaining a more organized and readable code. For this specific assignment,  I found that it was helpful to consult with the provided resources in the Readme file for certain hashtable functions. In addition, doing some research on W3 Schools also helped me understand more about how hashtables can be used and the proper way to format them. I would recommend starting the assignment early and using all available resources, especially the ones outlined in the Readme. 

Victoria -I really like inheritance, I think it’s such an interesting and helpful tool to reuse work. I think it also makes our programming more connected and easy because we know where our “blueprints” come from (parent classes). I mostly worked in the cafe class. I didn’t know I had to use super so the cafe would be inside the building, which made sense once I understood why. I attend TA and Ab’s office hours to help me figure out a bug! I would recommend prospective students to go through the material and get help form the TA’s so you don’t get stuck on one problem!
