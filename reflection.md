- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Kiara Sunil Singh - My initial impression of inheritance is that it can be very useful and can make the coding process more efficient because it eliminates the need to rewrite existing code. I found that it can also help with maintaining a more organized and readable code. For this specific assignment,  I found that it was helpful to consult with the provided resources in the Readme file for certain hashtable functions. In addition, doing some research on W3 Schools also helped me understand more about how hashtables can be used and the proper way to format them. I would recommend starting the assignment early and using all available resources, especially the ones outlined in the Readme.
